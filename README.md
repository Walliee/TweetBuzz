TweetBuzz by Anshul Mehra and Srujan Saggam (0508749)

TweetBuzz is a data analytics web application
that focuses on a new web trend called microblogging.
TweetBuzz attempts to generate a
relevant summary of microblogs related to the
topic phrase provided by the user and analyses
sentiments of the microblogs and plots them on
map based on their geolocation. The plotted pins
are color-coded based on their emotional quotient.
The summary generated and graph based
statistics are shown. This is done by fetching the
latest tweets from one such microblogging website
called Twitter ! !
